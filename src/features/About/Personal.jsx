        An enthusiastic professional individual who is seeking a 
        new challenging career after many years of being a 
        competent electrical engineer with a comprehensive 
        knowledge of designing, developing and maintaining 
        electrical systems. A consistent track record of 
        successfully completing projects from the concept 
        through to design, implementation, testing and 
        handover. I am currently looking to change careers 
        to a software developer after recently starting to study 
        for a  BSc Computing and IT degree with the Open University. 
        I have completed 55% of the Full-Stack Engineer course on 
        Codecademy (covered HTML, CSS, Git, React, Redux, API calls, 
        node.js, Express.js etc).
